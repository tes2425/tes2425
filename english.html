		&emsp;&emsp;The <i>Sonnet 71</i> was written in the XVII century by the English
		poet and tragedy writer William Shakespeare. It is part of the Fair Youth sequence of
		sonnets and it was probably written in the 1590s. In this sonnet, Shakespeare talks to a
		young man that he loves very much, telling him not to cry when he will be gone, but only before the
		church bell finishes to warn the world of his death. Shakespeare wants to be forgotten 
		by the man, as he is afraid of making him sad, telling him even to forget his name.
		He is also frightened that the pain felt can cause him to be mocked, riuning his reputation.
		Here the writer talks about love, but also of the inevitabilty of the death,
		that Shakespeare seems to accept.<br>
		The structure can be described as follows: it's an English sonnet (also called 
		Shakesperean sonnet), which is formed by three quatrains followed by a
		final couplet with a <i>abab-cdcd-efef-gg</i> rhyme scheme. Every verse
		is composed by using the iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre in which five
		pairs of alternating strong and weak syllabes can be found. Representing with <i>!</i>
		a strong syllabe and with <i>;</i> a weak sillabe, we can describe the iambic pentameter as<br><br>
		<i><mark>;&emsp;!</mark>&ensp;<mark>;&emsp;!</mark>&ensp;<mark>;&emsp;!</mark>&ensp;
			  <mark>;&emsp;!</mark>&ensp;<mark>;&emsp;!</mark></i><br><br>
		The pairs were highlighted in yellow. To make an example, we can take the first verse of the sonnet
		in which the iambic pentameter can be identified:<br><br>
		<i>No longer mourne for me when I am dead</i><br>
